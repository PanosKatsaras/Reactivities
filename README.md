# Reactivities Application

This repository contains a .NET Core backend and a React frontend (using TypeScript and Vite build tool) application for managing activities with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
The application also uses Axios for handling API requests/responses and Semantic-UI-React for styling and design.
